## Course Description and Objectives

This course is a comprehensive course designed to equip learners with the essential knowledge and practical skills to develop machine learning solutions with Python. This course begins with a historical overview of artificial intelligence and explores a thorough comparison of machine learning techniques, specifically on supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Students will design and implement machine learning applications using Python based on real-world problems. Finally, the course culminates in a case study, challenging students to synthesize their learning by proposing machine-learning solutions for current issues.

Upon completion of the course, the students can:

1. Describe the foundations of intelligent systems, including the history of AI, key concepts, and ethical considerations.
2. Explore approaches for representing knowledge and reasoning including agent-based models and their role in simulating complex systems.
3. Compare and contrast various machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning.
4. Utilize and implement appropriate machine learning tools and libraries with Python.
5. Analyze and propose a solution for a machine learning and/or hybrid intelligent system problem.
